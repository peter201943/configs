# Peter's Configs

Peter's conf-man controlled configs

TODO: Write README

TODO: Add `C:\Users\peter\.vscode` and Scan `C:\Users\peter\AppData`

TODO: Think about whether each folder should be treated as its own "config" (and thus "installable" as such, with unique paths for certain files)

TODO: How to handle nested/dependent/grouped configs? (eg, `windows-vs-code` and `windows-cmd-profile`)
